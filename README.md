# Tracker

This is a simple web app to track things on a daily basis. Values are stored in local storage on your browser.

Go to [http://tatumcreative.github.io/tracker](http://tatumcreative.github.io/tracker) to start tracking something. Add a hash at the end to track something specific. You can have more than one. For instance track how often you floss [http://tatumcreative.github.io/tracker/#Flossing](http://tatumcreative.github.io/tracker/#Flossing).
